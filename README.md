# micro-rti-build
Instructions for building an inexpensive micro-rti tool for high resolution surface detail imaging.

Details an improved MicroRTI build based on experiments undertaken during the proof of concept stage outlined in a blog post titled [MicroRTI: experiments in seeing really (really) close](http://digitalhumanities.soton.ac.uk/blog/southampton-dh/3272) published 02-09-2022. 

The second iteration build aims to:

– be replicable without the need for technical knowledge;
– use affordable and readily available tools and materials;
– be easily repaired;
– considerably reduce interruptions of the light cast on subjects by replacing the tripod (that holds the microscope) with a single support arm;
– ensure lighting from at least three angles of inclination between 15-65 degrees is available;
– be reasonably mobile and modular;
– physically accommodate the vast majority of objects for which Micro-RTI might be applied.
