# micro-rti-build
Instructions for building an inexpensive micro-rti tool for high resolution surface detail imaging.

Details an improved MicroRTI build based on experiments undertaken during the proof of concept stage outlined in a blog post titled *[MicroRTI: experiments in seeing really (really) close](http://digitalhumanities.soton.ac.uk/blog/southampton-dh/3272)* published 02-09-2022. 

The second iteration build aims to:

- be replicable without the need for technical knowledge;
- use affordable and readily available tools and materials;
- be easily repaired;
- considerably reduce interruptions of the light cast on subjects by replacing the tripod (that holds the microscope) with a single support arm;
- ensure lighting from at least three angles of inclination between 15-65 degrees is available;
- be reasonably mobile and modular;
- physically accommodate the vast majority of objects for which Micro-RTI might be applied.

MicroRTI Assembly 

Plywood Base 

  1. Cut 400mm x 400mm plywood square. 

  2. Locate and mark centre point of plywood square. 

  3. Fix one end of 200mm string to centre and another to a pencil to trace a circle with 200mm radius on to plywood square. 

  4. Cut out plywood circle. 

  5. Mark equal increments around perimeter of plywood circle (minimum 16) using permanent marker pen. 

  6. Drill five 3mm holes through plywood circle. One in centre and four equally spaced around the base c. 60mm from edge to produce a stable support.  

 
Microscope Support Arm (Figures 9 and 10) 

  1. Screw cable route to top of vertical support column using 1 x 10mm M2 bolt. 

  2. Screw lock plunger guide to vertical support arm using 2 x 10mm M2 bolts. Plastic may require filing to improve fit. 

  3. Slide lock plunger into the slot in the back of the vertical support arm and engage teeth of lock plunger and vertical support column. 

  4. Slide compression spring over 20mm M6 bolt. 

  5. Fit M6 nut in to recess at back of lock plunger guide. Plastic may require filing to improve fit. 

  6. Fit head of 20mm M6 bolt into recess into recess in lock plunger, compress spring, align bolt with nut and rotate for min of 3 threads. The teeth of the lock plunger and vertical support column should freely engage under the tension of the compression spring. Plastic may require filing to improve fit. 

  7. Attach microscope ‘C’ clamp to horizontal support arm using 1 x 10mm M2 nut and bolt. Fit microscope to clamp. 

  8. Route microscope cable through the cable route fixture.  

Fix microscope support to plywood base (Figure 11). 

  1. Place the assembly on top of the plywood base, disengage teeth of lock plunger from vertical support column and lower microscope until it meets surface of base.  

  2. Adjust the assembly so that the centre of the microscope lens aligns with the centre of the plywood base. 

  3. Fasten microscope support to the plywood base using 2 x Phillips head screws. 

  4. Affix both hook and loop sides of 2 x c.150mm strips of Velcro to base of subject plate.  Remove paper backing to expose adhesive. 

  5. Raise microscope to place subject plate. Align centres of subject plate and plywood base and press firmly to join the two. 

  6. Cut 5 pairs of hook and loop Velcro circles of c.20mm in diameter. Punch a hole through their centres using a paper hole punch. Remove paper to expose adhesive. 

  7. Place Velcro pairings onto tops of support feet by feeding 3mm pegs through the punched holes. 

  8. Guide each peg into the holes drilled into plywood board and press firmly to engage Velcro adhesive. 


Assemble light source and tripod arrangement. 

  1. Press fit the ball head of the tripod base into the cup of the tripod cradle. 

  2. Thread bolt through cradle until finger tight. 

  3. Place torch in cradle. 

  4. Thread Velcro strap through slits in cradle and secure torch in place. 

  5. Affix Velcro strips to underside of tripod base and top of two riser blocks.  

  6. Support barrier fits slots in to front of riser block(s) to prevent riser from sliding underneath platform and introducing variation in distance of lighting.
